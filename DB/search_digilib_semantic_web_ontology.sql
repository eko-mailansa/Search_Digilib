('A Semantic Knowledgebase Representation of  Geospatial Data in the Context of Bangladesh', 'There are a large amount of geospatial data available. A number of methods are also proposed for processing and retrieving geospatial information. However, end users ability to retrieve and link geospatial data is limited. Semantic knowledgebase of geospatial data provides information about places in the world and spatial relations between them. In this paper, we use semantic knowledgebase of geospatial data for retrieving user’s information efficiently in the context of Bangladesh. In our experiment, we mainly collect a lot of geospatial data from Bangladesh government website http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd and other sources. We exploit our geospatial data in a structured way by XML parsing on java platform. Our proposed method generates N-triples from the data of XML parsing. We use Protégé environment to build ontology. Ontology contained information about hierarchical data of Bangladesh. This approach helps us to represent semantic knowledgebase of geospatial data about Bangladesh more efficiently. Experimental result shows the effectiveness of our semantic knowledgebase structure. In addition, our experiment shows the efficiency of our system by retrieving information exactly from our ontology in a structured way.', 'Shohag Barman, Fahmid Al Farid, Nasir Uddin And Hanif Seddiqui ', '2014'),

The study focuses in particular on RDF stores, the software components dedicated to the storage, representation and retrieval of semantic information. Starting from a literature review, a qualitative analysis is carried out considering a set of these systems. RDF stores are evaluated to find the implementations that are best suited to play the role of backbone in a software architecture sharing information between the software tools adopted by the various stakeholders. This can be achieved if the architecture overcomes the problems deriving from the lack of integration between the involved software applications, providing in this way an integrated view on relevant engineering knowledge.', 'Gianfranco E.

('A Web-based Smart Inference System to Support Automated Generation of LCA Simulation Models', 'The decision on most eco-efficient production scheme for producing customized products is highly time consuming and error-prone as it depends on several factors most notably the geographical locations, legal requirements, materials characteristics and process related parameters. Furthermore, the planners must be experienced with the simulation tools as well as related terminologies, environmental laws and standards to conduct precise assessments. The limited functionalities of decision making tools as well as non-automated exchange of information and data, absence of environment related knowledge and non-standardized interfaces between the simulation tools and ERP/PLM systems make planners incapable of reaching quick decisions on eco-efficient choices.  \r\nThis paper proposes a web-based inference system seamlessly connected with the LCA simulation tools and legacy systems. The web-based software automatically analyzes the input on manufacturing alternatives to produce customized products and generates automatically the corresponding LCA simulation models. These models can be used inside LCA tools. ', 'Sarfraz Ul Haque Minhas And Ulrich Berger ', '2014'),

('An Introduction to Information Retrieval', 'As recently as the 1990s, studies showed that most people preferred getting\r\ninformation from other people rather than from information retrieval systems. Of course, in that time period, most people also used human travel agents to book their travel. However, during the last decade, relentless optimization of information retrieval effectiveness has driven web search engines to new quality levels where most people are satis?ed most of the time, and web search has become a standard and often preferred source of information ending. For example, the 2004 Pew Internet Survey (Fallows 2004) found that “92% of Internet users say the Internet is a good place to go for getting everyday information.” To the surprise of many, the field of information retrieval has moved from being a primarily academic discipline to being the basis underlying most people’s preferred means of information access. This book presents the scientific underpinnings of this field, at a level accessible to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates. \r\nInformation retrieval did not begin with the Web. In response to various\r\nchallenges of providing information access, the ?eld of information retrieval\r\nevolved to give principled approaches to searching various forms of content. The ?eld began with scienti?c publications and library records, but soon spread to other forms of content, particularly those of information professionals, such as journalists, lawyers, and doctors. Much of the scientific research on information retrieval has occurred in these contexts, andmuch of the continued practice of information retrieval dealswith providing access to unstructured information in various corporate and governmental domains, and this work forms much of the foundation of our book.', 'Christopher D.

('Applied Semantic Web Technologies', 'The Semantic Web term was popularized by Tim Berners-Lee and later elaborated in \r\n2001. The first part of his vision for the Semantic Web was to turn the Web into a truly collaborative medium—to help people share information and services and make it easier to aggregate data from different sources and different formats. The second part of his vision was to create a Web that would be understandable and processable by machines. While humans can read and comprehend current Web pages, Berners-Lee envisioned new forms of Web pages that could be understood, combined, and analyzed by computers, with the ultimate goal of enabling humans and computers to cooperate in the same manner as humans do among each other. Berners-Lee did not think of the Semantic Web as a replacement of the current Web. It was intended as an extension for adding semantic descriptions of information and services. Central to the Semantic Web vision is the shift from applications to data. The key to machine-processable data is to make the data smarter. As seen from Figure 1.1, data progress along a continuum of increased intelligence as described below.', 'Vijayan Sugumaran And Jon Atle Gulla', '2012'),

('Do Ontological Guidelines Improve Understandability of Conceptual Models? A Meta-Analysis of Empirical Work', 'Conceptual models are used to understand information systems application domains and to communicate about them in order to better understand system requirements.  Conceptual models are required to represent relevant aspects of the modeled domain faithfully, and be understandable. The use of ontological theories has been proposed to guide the creation of effective models. Specifically, Bunge’s \r\nontology has been applied to guide the use of the ERM, the UML, and business process grammars.  However, because the choice of ontology reflects beliefs, and \r\nmodel understanding involves human cognition, whether or not ontological guidance results in better models is an empirical question. Several empirical \r\nworks studied this issue, differing in grammars, modeling aspects, empirical tasks, and measures. We report a meta-analysis of published empirical research \r\nabout the impact of ontological guidance based on Bunge’s model, and user understanding of conceptual models. The results support the proposition that \r\nontological guidance can improve model understandability.', 'Arash Saghafi And Yair Wand', '2014'),

However, because there is a huge gap between what the human mind understands and \r\nwhat computers can interpret, a large amount of data on the Internet cannot be processed efficiently with computer software. For example, a scanned table in an image file is unstructured and cannot be interpreted by computers. While optical character recognition programs can be used to convert images of printed text into machine-encoded text, such conversions cannot be done in real time and with 100% accuracy, rely on a relatively clear image in high resolution, and require different processing algorithms, depending on the image file format.

('Ontology Management Semantic Web, Semantic Web Services And Business Applications', 'About fifteen years ago, the word “ontologies” started to gain popularity \r\nin computer science research.

It was novel in at least three senses: First, taking well-studied philosophical distinctions as the foundation for defining conceptual elements; this helps create more lasting data and object models and eases interoperability. Second, using  formal semantics for an approximate description of what a conceptual element’s intended meaning is. This helps avoid unintended interpretations and, consequently, unintended usages of a conceptual element. It also allows using a computer for reasoning about implicit facts. And, last but not least, this improves the interoperability of data and services alike. Third, ontologies are meant to be  consensual abstractions of a relevant field of interest, i.e., they are shared and accepted by a large audience. Even though the extreme stage of consensus in the form of a “true” representation of the domain is impossible to reach, a key goal is a widely accepted model of reality; accepted by many people, applicable for many tasks, and manifested in many different software systems.', 'Martin Hepp, Pieter De Leenheer, Aldo de Moor And York Sure ', '2008'),

('Programming the Semantic Web', 'Like biological organisms, computers operate in complex, interconnected environ-\r\nments where each element of the system constrains the behavior of many others. Similar to predator-prey relationships, applications and the data they consume tend to follow co-evolutionary paths. Cumulative changes in an application eventually require modification to the data structures on which it operates. Conversely, when enhancements to a data source emerge, the structures for expressing the additional information generally force applications to change. Unfortunately, because of the significant efforts involved, this type of lock-step evolution tends to dampen enhancements in both applications and data sources.\r\nAt their core, semantic technologies decouple applications from data through the use of a simple, abstract model for knowledge representation. This model releases the mutual constraints on applications and data, allowing both to evolve independently. And by design, this degree of application-data independence promotes data portability. Any application that understands the model can consume any data source using the model.\r\nIt is this level of data portability that underlies the notion of a machine-readable semantic web.', 'Toby Segaran, Colin Evans And Jamie Taylor', '2009'),

('Semantic Web-Based  Information Systems: State-of-the-Art Applications', 'Importance of semantics has been recognized in different areas of data and information management, including better access, exchange, interoperability, integration and analysis of data. Semantics of data is about associating meaning to data, and understand what data represents, and improve the value of data.  Early use of semantics in the context of data and information management occurred in the context of development of multidatabase or federated database systems, to be followed by mediator and information brokering architectures. As the Web started to take the shape as a global information system and as a way to connect distributed data repositories, usage of metadata and semantics correspondingly started in early 1990s and increased there after. The first use of the term “semantic information brokering” in 1993 conceived the use of semantics in the form of domain models and ontologies for heterogeneous data integration, and about the same time, ontology-based information integration was proposed in some mediator based projects. In the last two chapters of his book Weaving the Web (Harper, 1997), Tim Berners-Lee started to put forth a vision of the next phase of the Web in which semantics would play a critical role, and the term Semantic Web was coined. Research community, first supported by the DARPA’s DAML program (for which Jim Handler was the program manager) quickly saw the new research opportunity.

('The Semantic Web: A Guide to the Future of XML, Web Services, and Knowledge Management', 'The World Wide Web has dramatically changed the availability of electronically accessible information. The Web currently contains around 3 billion static documents, which are accessed by over 500 million users internationally. At the same time, this enormous amount of data has made it increasingly difficult to find, access, present, and maintain relevant information. This is because information content is presented primarily in natural language. Thus, a wide gap has emerged between the information available for tools aimed at addressing these problems and the information maintained in human-readable form.\r\n\r\nIn response to this problem, many new research initiatives and commercial enterprises have been set up to enrich available information with machine processable semantics. Such support is essential for "bringing the Web to its full potential." Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, referred to the future of the current Web as the Semantic Web-an extended web of machine-readable information and automated services that amplify the Web far beyond current capabilities. The explicit representation of the semantics underlying data, programs, pages, and other Web resources will enable a knowledge based Web that provides a qualitatively new level of service Automated services will improve in their capacity to assist humans in achieving their goals by "understanding" more of the content on the Web, and thus providing more accurate filtering, categorizing, and searching of these information sources. This process will ultimately lead to an extremely knowledgeable system that features various specialized reasoning services.

('Towards a Semantic Book Search Engine', 'Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) methods were initially used for searching and ranking webpages on the Web. These methods were progressively modified to exploit the peculiarities of the Web including the use of the hyperlinked \r\nstructure of the Web for relevance ranking. These Web IR techniques, however, are also being applied for searching and ranking to other forms of text collections which are not inherently web documents. Books (especially in PDF form) are by nature different from web pages because they lack an explicit \r\nhypertextual structure and therefore cannot be accurately and precisely searched and ranked using traditional approaches.\r\nBooks contain a highly structured content with implicit logical connections among different parts of the same book as well as to related content in other books. These book structural semantics and logical connections could be discovered and used to establish a web of books where the logical concepts, images, figures, tables, and other parts are linked with each other thus resulting in a semantic graph, which could then be exploited by a semantic \r\nbook search engine for more precise and accurate indexing, searching, ranking and recommendations. Based on this hypothesis, the paper outlines a high-level architecture for one of the possible implementations of a semantic book search engine, identifies all the potential areas of research for future researchers, and reports on our work in progress in the form of the proposed model for the purpose. The proposed architecture, if implemented in its true sense, has the potential to better serve the needs of all the stakeholders including authors, publishers, readers, and librarians.

In order to thoroughly understand assembly language, it is necessary to be familiar with the architecture of the computer on which the language is being used. For the X86 assembly language, this implies the Intel and Intel-like microprocessors. Programs written in assembly language are usually faster and more compact than programs written in a high-level language and provide greater control over the program application. Assembly language is machine dependent; that is, it is used only with a specific type of processor. A high-level language, however, is usually machine independent; that is, it can be used with any processor.', 'Joseph Cavanagh', '2013');

Unfortunately, because of the significant efforts involved, this type of lock-step evolution tends to dampen enhancements in both applications and data sources.\r\nAt their core, semantic technologies decouple applications from data through the use of a simple, abstract model for knowledge representation. This model releases the mutual constraints on applications and data, allowing both to evolve independently. And by design, this degree of application-data independence promotes data portability. Any application that understands the model can consume any data source using the model.\r\nIt is this level of data portability that underlies the notion of a machine-readable semantic web.', 'O’Reilly Media, Inc.', 'Toby Segaran, Colin Evans And Jamie Taylor', '300', '2009', 'English', 'PDF', 'Ebook', '4.88 MB'),

It was novel in at least three senses: First, taking well-studied philosophical distinctions as the foundation for defining conceptual elements; this helps create more lasting data and object models and eases interoperability. Second, using  formal semantics for an approximate description of what a conceptual element’s intended meaning is. This helps avoid unintended interpretations and, consequently, unintended usages of a conceptual element. It also allows using a computer for reasoning about implicit facts. And, last but not least, this improves the interoperability of data and services alike. Third, ontologies are meant to be  consensual abstractions of a relevant field of interest, i.e., they are shared and accepted by a large audience.

We demonstrate a novel machine-learning approach to theory identification based on citation data and library features. The multi-disciplinary ecosystem of librarys which cite a theory’s originating paper is created and refined into the network of papers predicted to contribute to, and thus identify, a specific theory. We provide a ‘proof-of-concept’ for a highly-cited theory. Implications for cross-disciplinary theory integration and the identification of theories for a rapidly expanding scientific literature are discussed.

('9781509055869', 'Towards a Semantic Book Search Engine', 'Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) methods were initially used for searching and ranking webpages on the Web. These methods were progressively modified to exploit the peculiarities of the Web including the use of the hyperlinked \r\nstructure of the Web for relevance ranking. These Web IR techniques, however, are also being applied for searching and ranking to other forms of text collections which are not inherently web documents. Books (especially in PDF form) are by nature different from web pages because they lack an explicit \r\nhypertextual structure and therefore cannot be accurately and precisely searched and ranked using traditional approaches.\r\nBooks contain a highly structured content with implicit logical connections among different parts of the same book as well as to related content in other books. These book structural semantics and logical connections could be discovered and used to establish a web of books where the logical concepts, images, figures, tables, and other parts are linked with each other thus resulting in a semantic graph, which could then be exploited by a semantic \r\nbook search engine for more precise and accurate indexing, searching, ranking and recommendations. Based on this hypothesis, the paper outlines a high-level architecture for one of the possible implementations of a semantic book search engine, identifies all the potential areas of research for future researchers, and reports on our work in progress in the form of the proposed model for the purpose. The proposed architecture, if implemented in its true sense, has the potential to better serve the needs of all the stakeholders including authors, publishers, readers, and librarians.

('978467399395', 'Ontology Based Semantic Web on Hadoop Platform', 'In recent times size of the data is increasing rapidly. Existing centralized system is not able to handle large dataset beyond a certain limit. So, we need ontology based approach in Semantic Web and distributed system. Ontology \r\ndescribes a formal specification of certain domain. Existing platform and servers are unable to process different types of data like structured, semi-structured and quasi- structured data to have an effective large number of ontologies in the web. We need the Hadoop platform to implement the incremental and distributed ontologies over and  above existing ontologies in Semantic Web. RDF is the basic representation of ontologies and it is used to describe the knowledge in the Semantic Web. The challenges is using RDF include structure of RDF and the memory that is needed for the incremental comparison. \r\nMapReduce is one of the main Hadoop components are needed during the mapping of ontologies in the Semantic Web using RDF. In this paper better way of using incremental RDF in Semantic Web is discussed.
